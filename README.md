# Lessons-from-Titanic
This notebook is an attempt to learn some lessons from the sinking of RMS Titanic in 1912. Although titanic might not be the worst shipwreck of all time in terms of fatalities (the 1987 loss of the ferry Do√±a Paz, with an estimated 4,386 dead is the largest non-military loss recorded), yet no doubt it is the most famous.

Using [Titanic Dataset](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2016/September/57e9a84c_titanic-data/titanic-data.csv),  we will try to answer some questions to learn from this disaster:
- What should we learn from this tragedy? And how can we manage such situations in best possible way?
- Was the "women and children first" policy effective across all classes?
- Was class, or fare a factor in survival after all?

## Source of dataset
Data contains demographics and passenger information from 891 of the 2224 passengers and crew on board the Titanic. You can view a description of this dataset on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data), where the data was obtained.

## Usage
The code was written with Python 2.7. running the code in python 3 will result in errors. You can open the [notebook](https://github.com/Mahmoud-AbouZeid/Lessons-from-Titanic/blob/cleaning/The%20Sinking%20of%20RMS%20Titanic.ipynb) directly on github, but it is better viewed via [nbviewer here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Mahmoud-AbouZeid/Lessons-from-Titanic/blob/cleaning/The%20Sinking%20of%20RMS%20Titanic.ipynb). There is a toggle button to toggle on/off the code cell, toggle off for more readable version if you are not interested in the code.
